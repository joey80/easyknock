Easyknock Code Test - Joey Leger

Requirements 
Build a React app with a single form that collects the following information 
● Street Address 
● City 
● State 
● Zip Code 
With the above information, query this Estated API , and then render the entire property response on the page in any format you’d prefer (raw pretty print JSON is fine!). Signup for a free Estated API account to retrieve a developer API key (good for 100 free requests) 
● No unit or integration tests needed (too little time for that!) 
● Commit to your personal Github repo 
● Submit your Github repo link no later than 4 hours after starting, don’t worry if you cannot finish the entire project!
